 You are designing the control software for a satellite subsystem. The engineers of the subsystem have installed
 numerous temperature sensors throughout their device and require that these sensors are regularly monitored.
 To aid in their testing, the control software should store the average value recorded on each sensor, as well as
 its highest and lowest recorded values. These values must be reported on command. Please provide a code
 sample or MWE demonstrating how this area of the software would work. The code does not need to compile
 but should be syntactically correct. All code should be written in C.
